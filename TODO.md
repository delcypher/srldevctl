* Remove references to projector and instead refer to "device"
* Fix model declarations to support sending commands with arbitrary values (e.g. integers)
* Fix model declarations to support parsing device response
* Fix thread safety
* Allow serial timeout to be set from configuration file
* Move to Qt5 (I only used Qt4 because I'm more familiar with it and don't have time to learn the differences in Qt5)
